# Queue — active work

**The one question:** what work is to-be / being done?

Orchestrator-owned. Actionable items only (impl / spec / docs / chore /
bug). Factual spec↔impl mismatches live in `divergences.md`; undecided
behavior in `design-questions.md`; version mapping in `milestones.md`;
present-state in `snapshot.md`. Each item has a stable ID, named once
here and referenced elsewhere. Raw OPEN/FOUND tags arrive via PR
descriptions; the orchestrator triages them into the right file.

Schema: `[ID] title — type · status · owned-files · blocked-by ·
links · note`. Status ∈ {ready, in-flight, blocked, deferred}.

_**Last reconciled 2026-06-09 — main 9232528, 0 open PRs, clean, CI green. ★ VS CODE EXTENSION QUALITY HARDENING (operator-initiated).**
While the v1 compiler backlog is Design-gated (DQ29/DQ30), the operator opened a new workstream: evaluate the VS Code extension
and improve quality/reliability/feature-set, sequenced **reliability → tests → infra → docs/quick-wins, paralleling where
feasible**. A 2-agent read-only evaluation mapped the extension (~4.8k LOC, 7 feature modules); findings drove two file-disjoint
parallel waves, each combined-tree re-verified locally (npm ci/lint/compile/test) before merge:
**WAVE 1 — reliability (#308 ⨯ #309, disjoint pair):** **#308** activation resilience — a broken (not just missing) `bock`
binary or corrupt `vocab.json` no longer bricks the whole UI (`startLspClient` never throws; `VocabService.load` degrades to an
empty-but-usable vocab; features/commands/context-key always register) + scoped hover command-trust (`isTrusted` →
`{enabledCommands:['bock.openSpecAt']}`). **#309** decision-record schema validation (malformed records dropped+counted+surfaced,
no more crash-on-render) + effect-flow auto-render debounced (was re-running a workspace-wide scan on every hover) + incremental
annotation scan (was full-workspace re-read on every save) + **fixed a real `scanText` triple-quote false-negative** (a `"""` in a
comment/string suppressed all later annotations; pure scanner extracted to `annotations-scan.ts`).
**WAVE 2 — test foundation (#310 ⨯ #311, disjoint pair):** **#310** effect-analyzer parser helpers (matchDelimiter,
findEnclosingFunction [suspected innermost bug proven NOT real], splitBindings, parseWithClause, expandEffects, offsetToLocation)
+ **#311** spec-panel helpers (normalizeRef, buildNavTree, highlightBock, parseSections, stripForSearch, linkifySpecRefs).
Additive `export`s only, zero behavior change. **Extension test suite 7 → 117.**
**2 FOUNDs (real pre-existing bugs surfaced by #310's tests, pinned with KNOWN-BUG tests):** Q-ext-parsewithclause-effect-underreport
(HIGH-ish — same-line `fn f() -> T with E {` has its ` with E` eaten by the greedy return-type strip → the effect-flow panel
under-reports effects for MOST functions, the dominant signature shape) + Q-ext-splitbindings-string-aware (LOW). **Remaining
extension threads (queued, not started):** Q-ext-infra-webview-consolidation (thread 3 — invasive), Q-ext-docs-and-quickwins
(thread 4), + a feature-opportunity backlog (richer hover, spec-search ranking, decisions filtering — many align with the
extension's own README v1.1 roadmap). ↓ —

Solo engineer lane (the smaller of the two open `ready` items; the other is `solo` and they collide on `py.rs`, so they
sequence). **#306** Q-py-enum-variant-import (python import lowering drops **unaliased** braced enum-variant leaf names from
`from {module} import …` — the variant is emitted as the dataclass `Ordering_Less`, not `Less`, so the bare-name import raised
`ImportError`; reached now via use-site + implicit-import, mirroring the js/ts `Named` filter and the #303 rust fix; `python`
re-added to the variant-bracing fixture). PR-own-CI was the combined-tree check (solo on unchanged base): full CI green — all 6
test cells, clippy, blocking examples matrix, stdlib-fmt; conformance REQUIRE=all **824/0/0** ×5. Orchestrator re-verified the
diff scope (2 owned files) + CI before squash-merge. **1 CLOSED.** **The enum-variant-import mirror is now COMPLETE across
js/ts/python/rust** (go never affected). **BOARD NOW DESIGN-GATED:** the two remaining backlog items both await an owner ruling
and there is **no autonomous `ready` engineering left**: (1) **Q-list-mut-pop-insert-remove → DQ30 (NEW, escalated)** — §18.3 is
silent on `pop`/`insert`/`remove`/`reverse` return contracts (contested: `remove` by-index return type, OOB behavior,
`pop`-on-empty); surfaced to owner, deferred ("will circle back"); (2) **Q-equatable-gating-user-types → DQ29** (still pending).
**Awaiting owner: DQ30 ruling** (List mutator signatures — recommended **Optional-safe**: `pop`→`Optional[T]`, `remove(i)`→`Optional[T]`,
`insert(i,v)`→`Void`, `reverse`→`Void`, all `mut self`) **+ DQ29 ruling** (Equatable `==`/`!=` gating — recommended **R1

  return undefined); `VocabService.load` degrades to an empty-but-usable vocab on read/parse failure (all getters null-safe);
  features/commands/`workspaceHasBockFiles` always register → a broken binary / corrupt vocab no longer bricks the UI (the
  README's graceful-degradation promise is now real). Hover `isTrusted` scoped to `{enabledCommands:['bock.openSpecAt']}`. #309:
  decision-record `isValidDecisionRecord` guard (drop+count+`showWarningMessage`, defensive render); effect-flow auto-render
  routed through the 300ms debounce; annotation watcher made incremental (per-file store, splice on change/create/delete; full
  scan only on init + explicit refresh); **`scanText` triple-quote false-negative fixed** (string/comment-aware `nextTripleState`;
  pure scanner extracted to `annotations-scan.ts`). Regression tests shipped with each fix.
- **[Q-ext-test-foundation] unit-test the extension's pure parser/render helpers** — test · **DONE (#310 + #311; effects/hover deferred)** ·

  additive exports, no behavior change); #311 covers spec-panel (normalizeRef, buildNavTree, highlightBock, parseSections,
  stripForSearch, linkifySpecRefs). **Extension test suite 7 → 117.** `effects.ts`/`hover.ts` pure helpers (buildMermaid,
  stringifyHoverContents, …) still untested because those modules import `vscode-languageclient/node` (unresolvable under the
  ts-node test harness) → their pure logic must be EXTRACTED first; folded into Q-ext-infra-webview-consolidation (thread 3).

  (#310 tests). The greedy return-type strip `/->\s*[^\n{]*/` eats ` with E` on the idiomatic `fn f() -> Void with Logger,
  Storage {` shape (confirmed against `examples/spec-exercisers/effect-showcase`), so `parseWithClause` returns `[]` and the
  effect-flow visualization shows no handled effects for the dominant signature form. A KNOWN-BUG test pins the current (wrong)
  behavior; flip it when fixed. Fix: stop the return-type strip at a top-level ` with ` boundary (mind `with` inside a generic /
  nested type). Higher user-impact than the infra/docs threads.

  links #308-#311, Q-ext-test-foundation · note: FOUND by the 2026-06-09 evaluation. `WebviewPanelBase` is dead code (nothing
  extends it); spec-panel + effects each hand-roll their own panel/CSP/nonce/escape (3 copies of `randomNonce`, 2 of
  `escapeHtml`, ~150 lines of overlapping CSS); the CSP nonce uses `Math.random()` not crypto; `truncate` is duplicated across
  decisions/annotations. Consolidate onto one `WebviewManager` (with per-feature CSP extension points for effects' mermaid
  `script-src`), delete `WebviewPanelBase`, crypto-secure the nonce, extract shared helpers. En route, extract effects/hover pure
  helpers (buildMermaid, stringifyHoverContents) into harness-testable modules + cover them (completes Q-ext-test-foundation).
  Wide blast radius → scope/sequence carefully.

  inline `[T: Ranked]` worked (lands on `GenericParam.bounds`) but `where`-clause bounds land in a separate field the ts/go

  seam entirely inside bock-fmt — `format_module` re-derives each `//!` line's content from the RAW comment stream
  (`comments.rs` already extracts it verbatim), stripping only the marker + ≤1 space and trimming trailing ws, so indentation
  is preserved; **the lexer was not touched** (parser/`bock doc`/LSP unaffected — the feared ripple avoided). `///` item docs
  already preserved indentation (only `//!` was broken). 4 new round-trip+idempotence tests; stdlib-fmt-check stays clean. ORIG:

  keep it); `iter.bock` now folds into the stdlib-fmt gate. ORIG FOUND 2026-06-07 (#272). `bock fmt` rewrote a
  control-flow match-arm body like `None => break` to `None => break,`; the parser then rejects the formatted file (`E2020
  expected expression, found ','`). Caught by the #272 stdlib-fmt behavior-equivalence check (it mangled `iter.bock`). Blocks
  folding `iter.bock` into the `stdlib-fmt` gate. Suppress the trailing comma when an arm body is a control-flow statement
  (`break`/`continue`/`return`/loop tail).

  divider comment (81 chars / 200+ bytes) panicked the formatter — `end byte index
  100 is not a char boundary` — the line-wrap slices at a byte offset that lands inside a multi-byte char. Blocks folding

  the checker doesn't type-check impl/class method bodies so the recv_kind stamp isn't applied there).** Original detail:
  EXACT root cause was
  a List functional METHOD with a closure is lowered with the **free-function calling convention** — the receiver is
  emitted as an explicit first argument: `data.map(data, (dp) => …)` (verified in TS output). Effect per target: **TS**
  array-not-assignable-to-callback + implicit-any params; **rust** `no method 'map'/'filter' on Vec` (needs
  `.iter().map().collect()`); **go** `found 'map'` syntax-error (`map` keyword) + `.filter` undefined; **js** runtime
  "object is not a function" / "nodes.map is not a function"; **python** `'list' object has no attribute 'map'/'filter'`.
  BROADEST single bug — ~10 examples (data-pipeline, markdown-parser, task-api, inventory-system, ownership-demo,
  ml-data-prep, react-components, systems-allocator, type-zoo, todo-list). Distinct from `core.iter`'s FREE functions
  (conformance-tested + pass) — which is why conformance is 430/0 green while real programs fail. Checks clean ⇒ §20.4
  transpiler bug. Fix the method-call lowering to use each target's native chain (no dup receiver, typed closure params).

  conformance fixtures (430/0 green while real programs fail). Build the gate: for each example × target, project-mode
  `bock build` (compile) + run where possible (ts via `node --experimental-strip-types`; rust `cargo run`; go `go run .`;
  js `node`; py `python3`). **Land NON-BLOCKING (reports the matrix per PR), then ratchet per-target pass-thresholds

  `generator::is_list_concat` reads it + a list-literal syntactic fallback; per-target concat idioms (`[...a,...b]` js/ts,
  clone+extend rust, append-helper go, native `+` py). **CAVEAT: a bare `self.a + self.b` list concat INSIDE an impl
  method won't get the checker stamp (Q-impl-body-typecheck); the syntactic fallback covers the common `xs + [..]` shape.**
  Original: FOUND 2026-06-03 (audit). Bock list
  append/concat via `+` (`(self.items + [todo])`) lowers to a native `+` op: **ts** `Operator '+' cannot be applied to
  T[]`, **rust** E0369 `cannot add Vec<T> to Vec<T>`, **go** `operator + not defined on []T`. js silently does the wrong
  thing (string-concat), python coincidentally works (list `+`). Lower to each target's concat idiom (spread / `extend` /

  runtime-error), folded into Q-py-circular-import (K) + a trait-symbol-not-emitted residue — **no remaining BUILD-level
  work here**. Original: FOUND 2026-06-03 (audit). A constant or
  enum-variant name is emitted with one casing at the DEFINITION and another at the USE site: TS defines `FIZZ_NUM` but
  references `fizzNUM` (`Did you mean 'FIZZ_NUM'?`); `Category_Electronics`/`Allocatable` referenced-but-undefined; python
  references `FIZZ_NUM` but never emits the def at module scope. Normalize the identifier transform so def and use agree
  (and ensure module-scope consts are emitted). Examples: fizzbuzz, inventory-system, systems-allocator. Likely cheap.

  fully resolved:** turning on body-checking surfaced exactly two latent issues — (1) a **REAL pre-existing bug** in

  whose name collides with a method resolved the METHOD in value position → E4001; affected ALL core modules transitively
  + user-facing; fixed by preferring the same-named field in value position, method *calls* re-resolve via new
  `resolve_user_method_fn_type`), and (2) a `Self`-in-plain-impl return-type **false positive** (the `TypeSelf` arm now
  consults `gp_map["Self"]`). Conformance **455→460** (REQUIRE=all; +5 new `exec_method_body_list_ops` ×5). Negative
  diagnostics fixtures added (impl + class method-body type errors now caught). **HONEST PAYOFF:** the value is the
  **correctness** dimension (catching method-body type errors + the latent core.error bug) — NOT new codegen reach:
  example output (todo-list ×5) is **byte-identical** before/after because codegen already had robust syntactic fallbacks
  for method-body list ops. NEW residue OPENs surfaced (pre-existing, codegen-crate) → folded into Q-examples-codegen-misc
  (h)/(i). [The core.error checker-resolution fix is distinct from the codegen field/method collision work in

  (+ `bock-types/checker.rs` string_concat stamp) · — · links MS-examples-hardening, #210, Q-string-num-jstspygo · note:
  FIXED on RUST by #210 — lowered String `slice`/`substring`/`char_at`/`index_of`/`repeat`/`reverse`/`trim_*` + numeric
  `to_float`/`to_int`/`abs`/`min`/`max`/`clamp`/`floor`/`ceil`/`round`/`sqrt`/… to native rust; new checker `string_concat`
  stamp lowers `String + String` to `format!`. Fixture `exec_rust_string_num_methods` (rust-only). **The same lowerings
  are MISSING on js/ts/python/go → split out to Q-string-num-jstspygo (below).**
- **[Q-string-num-jstspygo] String/numeric method lowering missing on js/ts/python/go (§18.3)** — bug ·
  **DONE → #213 (hotfix #214)** · `compiler/crates/bock-codegen/` (js/ts/py/go) · — · links MS-examples-hardening, #210,
  #213, #214, §18.3, Q-py-windows-utf8 · note: FIXED by #213 — String + numeric/Char/Bool §18.3 methods now lower to each
  target's native idiom on js/ts/python/go (was rust-only #210), gating on `recv_kind = "Primitive:<Ty>"` via
  `try_emit_string_method`/`try_emit_numeric_method`; `generator.rs` untouched. Fixture promoted to all-5
  (`string_num_methods.bock`); conformance 476→480. **microservice ts FAIL→PASS** (the `slice` 3-arg fix); go advanced
  past `String.slice` (now hits the deeper chain — match-binding + Result-payload). **INCIDENT: #213 merged with a
  failing windows-python lane** (the all-5 fixture printed multibyte slice output; Windows-Python stdout = locale codepage,
  not UTF-8 → mismatch). Hotfix **#214** made the fixture ASCII-output; main green. Root product issue → Q-py-windows-utf8.
- **[Q-py-windows-utf8] Bock-generated Python should force UTF-8 stdout (cross-platform unicode)** — bug ·
  **DONE → #218** · `compiler/crates/bock-codegen/` (py) · — · links #213, #214, #218, MS-examples-hardening · note:
  FIXED by #218 — entry-only `sys.stdout/stderr.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8")` in `main.py` (py3.7+; verified not emitted
  in non-entry modules). Re-enables a multibyte-rune fixture later. Original: FOUND 2026-06-03 (#214
  incident). Windows-Python defaults stdout to the locale codepage, so a Bock program that `print`s multibyte/unicode
  emits mismatched/garbled bytes on Windows (passes on Linux/macOS). Emit a stdout UTF-8 reconfigure at the Python entry
  point (`sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8")`, py3.7+, entry module only) so unicode output is cross-platform. Real
  product correctness gap; surfaced when the string_num_methods fixture printed a multibyte slice. Re-enables a
  multibyte-rune-correctness fixture (currently ASCII-only per #214).
- **[Q-js-effect-export] JS: effect-group/stack export referenced but not emitted** — bug ·
  **DONE → #217** · `compiler/crates/bock-codegen/` (js) · — · links MS-examples-hardening, #155, #157, #217 · note:
  FIXED by #217 — a public composite effect now emits a `const X = Object.freeze({__composite:[…]})` binding so the ESM
  export resolves (effect-showcase, task-api, microservice js — all build+run). [Part of the js-backend batch #217.]
- **[Q-py-circular-import] Python: multi-module emit produces a circular import** — bug ·
  **DONE → #218** · `compiler/crates/bock-codegen/` (python) · — · links MS-examples-hardening, #182, #218 · note: FIXED
  by #218 — ROOT CAUSE was the implicit-import scan matching record/enum/class **field-label** tokens in the AIR debug
  dump as cross-module references (`InventorySummary.total_value` field ↔ `service.total_value` fn). Fixed by counting
  field-label occurrences across all label positions and subtracting them from the scan; `models.py` no longer imports
  `service`. inventory-system python now runs (the lone py example that flipped fail→pass in the matrix). [batch #218.]
- **[Q-examples-codegen-misc] Examples audit: minor / per-example codegen + stub-quality gaps** — bug · ready (low-pri,
  triage individually) · `compiler/crates/bock-codegen/`, `examples/` · — · links MS-examples-hardening · note: FOUND
  2026-06-03 (audit). Smaller items surfaced: (a) `todo`/unimplemented expression in return position → `return throw …`
  (js) / `return raise …` (py), invalid syntax — partly example **stub-quality** (guessing-game has unfinished bodies);
  (b) reserved-word / identifier collisions — `eval` (calculator js, `Invalid use of 'eval'`), redeclared `list`
  (todo-list js); (c) `Char` type unmapped on ts/rust/go (type-zoo); (d) go unused-var strictness `declared and not used`
  (guessing-game); (e) local `step2` binding not emitted (calculator go/py `undefined: step2`); (f) **[from #205]**
  `.for_each` with a BLOCK / mutating / `println` closure body fails on go/python (the pre-existing
  statement-closure-body gap — `for_each` lowering itself is correct on rust/js/python; excluded from the all-5 fixture);
  (g) **[from #205]** chained `.map(..).reduce(..)` over a record-field projection mislowers on go (nested-IIFE inference
  gap; binding the projection to a typed `let` first works ×5); (h) **[from #207]** go: a `list.map(...)` result returned
  DIRECTLY lowers its element type to `[]interface{}` (fails `go build`) — go generic-element-typing residue of cluster A
  at the free-fn level; the typed-`let` pattern avoids it; (i) **[from #207]** js/ts: a `let` binding that is REASSIGNED
  (`let list = …; list = list.add(…)`) is emitted as `const` → Node `Identifier 'list' has already been declared` (this
  precisely diagnoses the audit's "redeclared `list`", item (b) — a `let`-reassignment-vs-`const` lowering bug; affects
  todo-list js); (j) **[from #210]** rust: guard-`let` pattern lowered to a boolean guard → E0600/E0425 unbound `val`/`val2`
  (ownership-demo); (k) **[from #210]** rust: `mut <param>` not emitted as `mut` → E0384 (ownership-demo); (l) **[from #210]**
  rust: list-pattern emitted as a slice pattern → E0529 (ownership-demo); (m) **[from #209]** go: Result-payload
  type-assert error after the boxing fix (calculator, effect-showcase go); (n) **[from #213]** go: `Char.to_string()`/
  `display` emits `fmt.Sprintf("%v", rune)` → prints the code-point integer (`65`) not the char (`A`); pre-existing
  primitive-*bridge* path (not the method lowering), compounded by the boxed-Optional Char payload. Triage each as its
  own fix or example correction.
  **RESOLVED in the 5-backend fan-out (#216–#220):** (a) py todo-expr → #218; (i) js let-rebind-const → #217 (ts/py/go
  residue → Q-let-shadow-const); (j) rust guard-let → #216 (other backends → Q-guard-let-shared); (k) rust mut-param →
  #216; (l) rust list-pattern → #216 (shared → Q-list-range-pattern-shared); (m) go Result-payload → #220; (n) go
  Char-display → #220 (`string(rune)`); (d) go unused-var → #220; go int/int64 width → #220; (b) js `eval` reserved-word
  → #217. REMAINING: (c) `Char` type unmapped on rust/go (ts done #219 → string); (e) `step2` local-binding (re-check;
  likely fixed by go batch). Still grab-bag for residual one-offs.

  ⮑ codegen-completeness milestone #131-#152 essentially DONE — substrate complete + now EXERCISED by a full generic stdlib module (core.iter) on all 5
  ⮑ iter DONE on all 5: module + for→Iterable checker desugar (#151) + Rust/Go generic-combinator codegen (#152), ~300 exec ×5
(decided-ready: Q-import-reject [DQ8])

```

**Critical path to v1.0 (2026-05-30, updated):** the Optional-payload codegen family is CLOSED across all 5
(#124/#126/#127) and the for→Iterable desugar is PROVEN — but `core.iter` (a sensitive probe) exposed that
the v1 codegen substrate is materially incomplete: a **3-agent audit** found **cross-module `use` and
user-defined enums broken on ALL 5**, and Result/generics/closures/Optional-methods broken on 3-4/5
(audit.md 2026-05-30 18:00). The "5-target parity" #114-#121 restored was real only for a narrow slice; the
3 "landed" stdlib modules are **check-only, never executed cross-module**. Operator decided (2026-05-30): a
**codegen-completeness MILESTONE** (`Q-codegen-completeness`, v1-BLOCKING, ~10-15 PRs, phased P0-P4, mostly
bock-codegen → sequential) — fix comprehensively, THEN resume the stdlib. Updated path:
**Q-codegen-completeness (P0 cross-module+enums+tail-`if` → P1 stdlib-types → P2 traits+match → P3 Go-typing
→ P4 polish) → Q-stdlib R1 (iter, effect) → R2 → R3 → D4 → D5 → ItemB**. Phase-0 design in flight.
