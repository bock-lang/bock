# Queue — active work

**The one question:** what work is to-be / being done?

Orchestrator-owned. Actionable items only (impl / spec / docs / chore /
bug). Factual spec↔impl mismatches live in `divergences.md`; undecided
behavior in `design-questions.md`; version mapping in `milestones.md`;
present-state in `snapshot.md`. Each item has a stable ID, named once
here and referenced elsewhere. Raw OPEN/FOUND tags arrive via PR
descriptions; the orchestrator triages them into the right file.

Schema: `[ID] title — type · status · owned-files · blocked-by ·

## Ready

- **[Q-import-reject] Reject bare module-qualified import** — bug · ready ·
  `compiler/crates/bock-parser|bock-types/` · — · links DQ8 · note: a `use` of a
  module path with neither a brace-list nor a wildcard (bare `use core.error`) is
  not a v1 form; reject with a diagnostic pointing at the braced form. Decided by
  DQ8; module-qualified access deferred to v1.x.
- **[Q-interp-enum] interpreter execution gaps for stdlib dispatch** — bug ·
  ready · interpreter crate · — · links #104, #110, #121 · note: PARTIALLY fixed
  by #121 (defect #5: method bodies now run with a globals-bearing env, so
  `Some`/`None`/top-level fns + imported enum variants resolve in method bodies —
  this likely closed the #104 `Ordering.Less` case). REMAINING (verify): the #110
  convert dispatch gaps — user associated fns, the bodyless blanket `.into()`,
  builtin-shadowed `to_string`. Re-test against #121; close or scope the residue.
- **[Q-self-subst] checker: `Self` not substituted in impl method sigs** — bug ·
  ready · `compiler/crates/bock-types/` · — · note: an impl writing
  `fn compare(self, other: Self)` → E4001 at call sites; the checker doesn't
  substitute `Self`→concrete in impl method signatures. Workaround: write the
  concrete operand type in impls. Narrow gap; low urgency. Found #104.
- **[Q-xmod-bounds] Cross-module where-bound enforcement** — bug · ready ·
  `compiler/crates/bock-types/` (export ABI) · — · links #108 · note: where-clause
  bounds on **imported** generic fns aren't enforced — `ExportedSymbol` carries no
  trait bounds. Locally-defined bounds enforce (#108); thread bounds through the
  export ABI. Pairs with Q-xmod-impl (DV7/DV8 cross-module-impl theme).
- **[Q-xmod-impl] Cross-module trait-impl resolution for `.into()`** — bug ·
  ready · `compiler/crates/bock-types/` · — · links #110, DV8 · note: `.into()`
  resolves via the impl-table, not seeded across modules — an `impl From[A] for B`
  in module X isn't visible to `.into()` in module Y. Seed the impl-table
  cross-module. Pairs with Q-xmod-bounds.
- **[Q-prim-assoc] Primitive associated calls (`Float.from(3)`)** — bug · ready ·
  `compiler/crates/bock-types/` · — · links #110 · note: the resolver doesn't
  treat a primitive type name as an expression value, so `Float.from(3)` doesn't
  resolve (`.into()` is the working primitive path). Minor usability gap.
- **[Q-match-exprpos] Expression-position control-flow lowering — PER-BACKEND done; SHARED value-position desugar remains** —

  (#217–#220) lowered the **tractable** expr-position cases per-backend (ts ValueSink `let r; if{ r=… } else { return }`;
  py statement-form hoist; go value-IIFE + loop_expr_depth) — context-audit now runs on ts/py/go, guessing-game/pattern-lab
  advanced. **BUT all four sessions independently confirmed the genuinely-shared case** (`let x = loop {…}` / a value-position
  match/if whose arms DIVERGE) **needs a SHARED AIR temp-hoist desugar** (it currently emits `/* unsupported */` on the
  backends lacking the per-emitter workaround). That shared desugar is split out → **Q-exprpos-shared-desugar** (the real
  remaining core). This item now tracks only the per-backend emitter work (done); the shared desugar is the next focused
  (NON-parallel, generator.rs/AIR) session. Remaining example barriers routing through it: chat-protocol (early-return
  trapped in value-IIFE on go/ts), inventory map/fold.

  pre-pass `hoist_value_cf` (generator.rs), run atop every backend's generate_module/_project, chosen over the S-AIR layer
  because the synthesised temp's type is only derivable at codegen (go infers it structurally from the relocated node).
  Splices a declare-only temp before the consumer, relocates the CF to statement position rewriting value-tails to
  `temp = <v>` and keeping diverging tails verbatim, reads the temp. Covers let/return/assign/call-arg/const/fn-tail.

  control-flow expression whose arms DIVERGE (`let x = loop { … break v … }`, `let x = match s { A => v  B => return }`)
  has no clean per-backend IIFE lowering — needs a shared temp-hoist desugar (introduce a temp, lower the control-flow as
  statements assigning the temp, replace the expression with the temp) in the AIR/lowering layer so ALL backends emit valid
  code uniformly. The per-backend sessions each did the easy cases + reported this as the shared blocker. Do as ONE focused
  session (conflicts with all backend emitters → not parallelizable). Unblocks the last go/ts/chat-protocol barriers.

  `tools/examples-exec-baseline.txt` · — · links #221, #224 · note: FOUND 2026-06-04. #224 raised runtime-working js 14→16,
  rust 9→10, go 7→8 (chat-protocol js+go). Re-run `BOCK_EXAMPLES_UPDATE_BASELINE=1 tools/scripts/examples-exec-audit.sh` and
  commit the refreshed baseline (à la #221) to lock the gains as the regression floor; also drops the stale
  `guessing-game/rust` build entry (benign value-less tail-loop `/* unsupported */`, byte-identical on main).
- **[Q-conformance-target-race] Conformance exec test races on shared CARGO_TARGET_DIR (rust fixtures)** — bug · ready ·
  `compiler/crates/bock-test-harness/` · — · links #224 · note: FOUND 2026-06-04 (#224 verify). Under `cargo test
  --workspace` the rust execution fixtures run concurrent `cargo run` against one CARGO_TARGET_DIR → occasional
  cross-fixture stdout contamination (exec_map_literal / exec_list_first_last_concat got another fixture's output). Serial
  (`--test-threads=1`) is clean. Harness isolation gap, not codegen — give each rust fixture its own target dir or serialize
  the rust-exec group.
- **[Q-chat-protocol-residual] chat-protocol still fails ts/python/rust at runtime (unrelated to exprpos)** — bug · ready ·
  `compiler/crates/bock-codegen/` (rust/py/ts) · — · links #224 · note: FOUND 2026-06-04 (#224). After the exprpos desugar
  chat-protocol runs on js+go but still fails the other three for distinct reasons: **rust** `@concurrent`→tokio wiring + an
  `E0507` move in `serialize`; **python** forward-reference ordering (`Serializable` used before defined); **ts**
  `--experimental-strip-types` `.js`-import resolution. Three separable residual codegen gaps; split when picked up.
- **[Q-propagate-operator-noop] The `?`/Propagate operator is a no-op on js/ts/python (drops the unwrap)** — bug · **DONE (#226 js · #227 ts · #228 py · #229 go)** ·

  typed by the enclosing fn's return container; py: `_bock_try` unwrap + a `try/except _BockPropagate` envelope on the fn;
  go: `emit_try_unwrap` tag-test + zero-value/err early-return). Standard Rust-like semantics — NO Design escalation needed
  (DQ20's deferral resolved by implementation). RESIDUAL → Q-propagate-exprpos-shared (a nested `?` inside a larger
  expression `f(g()?)` has no expression-form early-return; js/ts/go all independently converged on this; no v1 example
  hits it).** ORIG: FOUND 2026-06-03 (#219, ts session). `expr?` (Result/Optional propagation) lowers to
  a no-op on js/ts/python — it does NOT unwrap the payload nor early-return the error, so a `BockResult<T,E>` flows where a
  `T` is expected (type-zoo, task-api remaining errors all trace here). Real semantics bug, not just codegen-shape. Lower
  `?` to each target's unwrap-or-early-return. Verify rust/go too. (DQ20 had deferred `expr?`; this re-opens it as v1.0
  example-blocking — may need a Design check on the exact semantics.)

  note: FOUND 2026-06-03 (fan-out). `generator::match_needs_ifchain` doesn't recognize `ListPat`/`RangePat`, so list-
  pattern (`[]`/`[x]`/`[first, *rest]`) and range-pattern (`1..10`) matches mis-lower. #217 (js) compensated LOCALLY via
  `match_has_unswitchable_pattern`; #216 (rust) did `as_slice()` matching; #218 (py) did `case` list-patterns — but a
  SHARED `match_needs_ifchain` extension would let all backends route uniformly (ts/go still fail to build these). Extend
  the shared recogniser. Examples: pattern-lab.

  real guessing-game blocker was a value-less tail-position loop falling through to `return /* unsupported */` / `# unsupported`
  — fixed alongside. guessing-game now builds clean ×5 (its run is gated only by its own `todo()` placeholder stubs).** ORIG:

  TS2451 — todo-list build→pass+run); py renames a shadowing inner-block binding to a fresh alias (`{name}__sN`, committed
  after the RHS so `let y = y + 10` still reads the outer `y`); go turns a colliding `:=` into reassignment.** ORIG: FOUND

  `e?`, tail); a `?` nested inside a larger expression (`f(g()?)`, `Ok(f()? + 1)`) has no expression-form early-return, so
  it's left un-hoisted. Same shape as Q-exprpos-shared-desugar → a shared pre-pass that hoists the `?` to a statement before
  the consumer. **No current v1 example hits it** (LOW priority; do when the exprpos-shared machinery is next touched).

  required (`t.Done undefined`, `cannot use …[]interface{} as []Todo`). Blocks todo-list on go; likely related to the older
  Q-list-method-codegen cluster. Thread the element type through the lambda + result slice.

  interpreter crate · — · links #151, #152 · note: a `loop { match it.next() }` drive over a
  `ListIterator` HANGS under the tree-walking interpreter — `mut self` cursor mutations don't persist
  across method calls, so `next()` never advances and `None` is never reached. Compiled targets (all 5)
  are fine; only `bock run` (interpreter) is affected. Pre-existing (the proven `generic_iter_concrete_match.bock`
  hangs identically) — NOT introduced by core.iter; surfaced by it. The `stdlib_iter.rs` smoke uses a single
  `next()` to avoid it. Fix: persist `mut self` field mutations across interpreter method-call frames.
  Same family as Q-interp-enum.

  a genuinely-unhandled bare op (no handler, no `with`) surfaces resolver **E1001** "undefined name" rather than the
  capability-pass **E8020** "effect operation has no handler" — because `EffectOp` AIR nodes are constructed ONLY in
  test code, so the E8020 check (`verify_capabilities.rs:476`) never fires on surface bare-op `Call`s. #155 kept
  E1001 for v1 (correct compile-time error per §10.3; the code is non-normative). To unify: lower recognized bare
  unhandled op `Call`s into `EffectOp` nodes so E8020 fires with the proper message. Non-urgent UX polish.

  (DONE this block → #155: Q-effect-interp-rust [Rust interpolation effect-op rewrite] + Q-effect-conformance-wiring
  [the inert effects/ suite now executes ×5]; DV16 RESOLVED.)
- **[Q-interp-effect-op-collision] Interpreter flat op-name→effect map can't disambiguate same-named ops** — bug ·
  ready (low-pri) · interpreter / `bock-cli/src/run.rs` · — · links #157 · note: the interpreter resolves bare effect
  ops through a FLAT op-name→effect-name map, so two effects sharing an op name (e.g. a user `effect Logger { fn log }`
  + the embedded `core.effect.Log { fn log }`) collide — only last-writer-wins. #157 made registration deterministic
  (topological order → user effects shadow core), which is correct + sufficient for v1, but full qualification (a
  program using BOTH same-named ops) is unsupported on the interpreter. Codegen (all 5 targets) is UNAFFECTED (each
  program compiles in isolation with proper module scoping). Low-pri interpreter-only limitation.
- **[Q-go-error-message] Go: `core.error.SimpleError` field/method name collision** — bug · **DONE (#191)** ·
  `bock-codegen/src/go.rs` · note: fixed in S6b — `go_method_name` disambiguates a public method colliding with a
  same-named record field to `<Name>Method` (applied at trait interface + receiver + call sites; field stays
  `Message`). Locked by a `go.rs` unit test + `conformance/exec/exec_core_error.bock` (rust+go). The js/ts/python
  variants of the same collision split out → **Q-error-message-jstspy** below.
- **[Q-error-message-jstspy] `core.error.message()` field/method collision also breaks js/ts/python** — bug · ready ·
  `bock-codegen/src/{js,ts,py}.rs` · — · links #191 · note: FOUND in S6b. The same `SimpleError { message }` field +
  `message()` method collision is **pre-existing on js/ts/python** (structural shadowing — TS: "Duplicate identifier
  'message'"; JS: instance field shadows the prototype method → `.message()` "not a function"; Python: dataclass field
  overwrites the method). Go fixed (#191); the `exec_core_error.bock` fixture is restricted to rust+go to keep
  conformance green. Each backend needs its own disambiguation (not just a name suffix). **Quality signal:** the v1
  stdlib was "complete" but `core.error.message()` was never exercised cross-target — a name-collision codegen pattern
  that may recur for other stdlib field/method pairs. Worth a pre-v1.0 fix; not on the ItemB critical path.
- **[Q-clock-handler-routing] `Instant.now`/`sleep` bypass the Clock effect handler** — bug · ready · `bock-codegen` ·
  — · links #160 · note: the time host primitives are inlined per-target and bypass the installed `Clock` handler, so
  `std.testing.MockClock` virtual-time (§18.4) is not achievable — `sleep` always hits real host. Route now/sleep/
  elapsed through the `Clock` handler. Codegen change; the time SURFACE works ×5 (core.time done) — this is the
  testability gap. Pairs with Q-time-shim-path.
- **[Q-conformance-clean-rebuild] Conformance harness doesn't force a clean `bock` rebuild** — chore/test-infra ·
  **DONE (#175)** · note: `run-conformance.sh` now `touch`es `compiler/crates/bock-cli/build.rs` + runs
  `cargo build -p bock --bin bock` before the tests, forcing a stdlib re-embed so `execution.rs::bock_binary()` can't
  reuse a stale sibling binary. Root cause confirmed: the build.rs `rerun-if-changed` on the stdlib tree misses a
  newly-added nested subdir. Local-verification false-REDs resolved.
- **[Q-r2-codegen-residue] R2 surfaced minor codegen/parser gaps** — bug · **mostly DONE** · links #163, #176 · note:
  (b) `List[String]` RECORD FIELD on Go → **DONE** (already-fixed by #168; pinned by `record_field_collection_concat.bock`
  in #176); (c) built-in `len`/`is_empty` lowering shadowing same-named user-record methods → **DONE (#176, ×5)** — was
  genuinely broken on all 5; root cause was `desugared_list_method` matching by name alone, fixed by gating on the
  checker's `recv_kind` stamp (+ `raw_recv_kind` reader, 2 unit tests, `user_method_shadows_builtin.bock`). (a) split out
  → **Q-allcaps-record-parse** (parser, separate). (d) String `reverse`/`char_at`/`slice` remain design-deferred (no
  cross-target char primitive; `s.reverse()` checks clean today) — tracked here, → DQ.
- **[Q-time-int64] §18.3.1 `Int64` realized as `Int`** — docs/spec · **DONE (#175)** · note: §18.3.1 prose now
  clarifies the time surface uses `Int` (i64-backed, full `Int64` range; no separate `Int64` surface type), reconciling
  the storage-width wording with the `Int` signatures. Verified wording-only (not a behavioral divergence). Changelog
  `spec/changelogs/20260601-1940-impl-changes.md`.
- **[Q-allcaps-record-parse] ALLCAPS record name not parsed as struct literal** — bug · ready ·

  position (`SB { ... }`) is not parsed as a struct literal → `E1001`. Split from Q-r2-codegen-residue (a); confirmed
  still present by #176 (out of that PR's codegen scope). Parser fix.
- **[Q-arch-doc-drift] ARCHITECTURE.md / compiler-CLAUDE.md / CONTRIBUTING.md crate-name drift** — docs/chore · ready ·
  `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `compiler/CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` · — · links #174 · note: D5 (#174) found the root
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `compiler/CLAUDE.md` name crates that **don't exist** (`bock-checker`, `bock-codegen-{js,ts,py,rs,go}`)
  and omit the real ones (type-checking is `bock-types`; all codegen is the single `bock-codegen`). Root `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  also describes conformance as `<name>.bock`/`<name>.expected` pairs, but the harness is `// TEST:`/`// EXPECT:`
  directive-driven. The D5 docs page documents reality + notes the divergence; reconcile these three source files to the
  real 17-crate workspace. (CLAUDE.md files are orchestrator/merge-coordinator territory.)

  EXACT root cause was
  a List functional METHOD with a closure is lowered with the **free-function calling convention** — the receiver is
  emitted as an explicit first argument: `data.map(data, (dp) => …)` (verified in TS output). Effect per target: **TS**
  array-not-assignable-to-callback + implicit-any params; **rust** `no method 'map'/'filter' on Vec` (needs

  "object is not a function" / "nodes.map is not a function"; **python** `'list' object has no attribute 'map'/'filter'`.

  (conformance-tested + pass) — which is why conformance is 430/0 green while real programs fail. Checks clean ⇒ §20.4

  conformance fixtures (430/0 green while real programs fail). Build the gate: for each example × target, project-mode
  `bock build` (compile) + run where possible (ts via `node --experimental-strip-types`; rust `cargo run`; go `go run .`;
  js `node`; py `python3`). **Land NON-BLOCKING (reports the matrix per PR), then ratchet per-target pass-thresholds
  upward to required as clusters land** (operator decision). Can run parallel to the cluster fixes (disjoint files).
  Note the in-repo cargo-workspace interaction (Q-rust-cargo-workspace) — fix it or build rust examples out-of-tree.
- **[Q-list-concat-codegen] List `+` concatenation emitted as native `+` (ts/rust/go)** — bug ·
  **DONE → #205** · `compiler/crates/bock-codegen/` (+ `bock-types/checker.rs` stamp) · — · links MS-examples-hardening,
  §20.4, #205, Q-impl-body-typecheck · note: FIXED by #205 — checker stamps `LIST_CONCAT_META_KEY` on a List `+`
  (`infer_binop`, checks result OR either operand for a concrete `List` to close the open-result-var case);
  `generator::is_list_concat` reads it + a list-literal syntactic fallback; per-target concat idioms (`[...a,...b]` js/ts,
  clone+extend rust, append-helper go, native `+` py). **CAVEAT: a bare `self.a + self.b` list concat INSIDE an impl
  method won't get the checker stamp (Q-impl-body-typecheck); the syntactic fallback covers the common `xs + [..]` shape.**
  Original: FOUND 2026-06-03 (audit). Bock list
  append/concat via `+` (`(self.items + [todo])`) lowers to a native `+` op: **ts** `Operator '+' cannot be applied to
  T[]`, **rust** E0369 `cannot add Vec<T> to Vec<T>`, **go** `operator + not defined on []T`. js silently does the wrong
  thing (string-concat), python coincidentally works (list `+`). Lower to each target's concat idiom (spread / `extend` /
  `append`). Examples: todo-list, expense-tracker, ownership-demo, systems-allocator.
- **[Q-const-enum-naming] Const / enum-variant identifier def↔use mangling mismatch (all 5)** — bug ·
  **CONST part DONE → #205; enum-variant/trait-name residue now RUNTIME (not build)** · `compiler/crates/bock-codegen/` ·
  — · links MS-examples-hardening, #205, Q-py-circular-import · note: #205 fixed the **const** def↔use mismatch
  (`collect_const_names` registry; consts emitted verbatim at def + use across all backends) — fizzbuzz now compiles on
  js/ts/py/rust. **POST-FIX MATRIX (15:24): the enum-variant (`Category_Electronics`) + trait/protocol-name
  (`Allocatable`) cases now BUILD but RUN-FAIL** on js/py (inventory-system, systems-allocator moved from build-error to
  runtime-error), folded into Q-py-circular-import (K) + a trait-symbol-not-emitted residue — **no remaining BUILD-level
  work here**. Original: FOUND 2026-06-03 (audit). A constant or
  enum-variant name is emitted with one casing at the DEFINITION and another at the USE site: TS defines `FIZZ_NUM` but
  references `fizzNUM` (`Did you mean 'FIZZ_NUM'?`); `Category_Electronics`/`Allocatable` referenced-but-undefined; python
  references `FIZZ_NUM` but never emits the def at module scope. Normalize the identifier transform so def and use agree
  (and ensure module-scope consts are emitted). Examples: fizzbuzz, inventory-system, systems-allocator. Likely cheap.
- **[Q-impl-body-typecheck] Checker does not type-check impl/class method BODIES** — bug ·
  **DONE → #207** · `compiler/crates/bock-types/` (checker.rs) · — · links #205, #207, Q-list-method-codegen,
  Q-list-concat-codegen, MS-examples-hardening, Q-go-error-message/Q-error-message-jstspy · note: FIXED by #207 —
  `check_item` now recurses into `ImplBlock`/`ClassDecl`, type-checking each method body as a function with `self` bound
  to the target + impl generics/`Self` substituted (`build_impl_context`). **Measure-then-fix blast radius was small +
  fully resolved:** turning on body-checking surfaced exactly two latent issues — (1) a **REAL pre-existing bug** in
  `core.error` (`impl Error for SimpleError { fn message(self)->String { self.message } }`: a `FieldAccess` to a field
  whose name collides with a method resolved the METHOD in value position → E4001; affected ALL core modules transitively
  + user-facing; fixed by preferring the same-named field in value position, method *calls* re-resolve via new
  `resolve_user_method_fn_type`), and (2) a `Self`-in-plain-impl return-type **false positive** (the `TypeSelf` arm now
  consults `gp_map["Self"]`). Conformance **455→460** (REQUIRE=all; +5 new `exec_method_body_list_ops` ×5). Negative
  diagnostics fixtures added (impl + class method-body type errors now caught). **HONEST PAYOFF:** the value is the
  **correctness** dimension (catching method-body type errors + the latent core.error bug) — NOT new codegen reach:
  example output (todo-list ×5) is **byte-identical** before/after because codegen already had robust syntactic fallbacks
  for method-body list ops. NEW residue OPENs surfaced (pre-existing, codegen-crate) → folded into Q-examples-codegen-misc
  (h)/(i). [The core.error checker-resolution fix is distinct from the codegen field/method collision work in
  Q-go-error-message/#191 + Q-error-message-jstspy/#193 — same pain point, different layer.]
- **[Q-go-enum-return-boxing] Go: enum variant not boxed into sealed-trait interface on return** — bug ·
  **DONE → #209** · `compiler/crates/bock-codegen/src/go.rs` · — · links MS-examples-hardening, #168, #209,
  Q-string-num-jstspygo, Q-match-exprpos · note: FIXED by #209 (4 root causes: block-in-expr-position closure dropped
  its statements + hardcoded `func() interface{}`; if/match IIFEs didn't propagate the concrete type into branch/arm
  bodies; untyped `let m = if{…}` over variants typed its closure from the fn return; void-call arm tails emitted
  `return println(..)` → the `(int,error)` arity error). Conformance +5 (`exec_enum_return_boxing` ×5). **HONEST: cleared
  the boxing/arity barrier on all 4 go examples but go examples STILL fail (matrix go 1/20 unchanged) — each now hits a
  NEXT barrier** (chat-protocol→early-return-trapped-in-IIFE = Q-match-exprpos; microservice→String.slice = Q-string-num-
  jstspygo + expr-position type-switch payload; calculator/effect-showcase→a single Result-payload type-assert on go).
  E was a necessary prerequisite, not sufficient — go needs the full chain (string-methods + match-exprpos + Result-payload).
- **[Q-rust-move-codegen] Rust: codegen produces borrow/move violations** — bug ·
  **DONE → #210** · `compiler/crates/bock-codegen/src/rs.rs` · — · links MS-examples-hardening, #149, #210 · note:
  FIXED by #210 — clone-on-reuse extended to fn/method params (`seed_reused_params`, skips Copy scalars), the
  desugared-self-call / MethodCall / bare-effect-op arg paths, `for x in coll` iterables, and closure-captured bindings
  (E0507); plus an adjacent effect-handler double-borrow fix (E0277 `&impl T: T`) via a `borrowed_handler_effects` set.
  New fixtures `exec_rust_move_reuse` (×5) + `exec_rust_effect_forwarding` (×5). Recovered rust examples (see Q-list-method
  matrix). [the #149 by-value-reuse follow-up is subsumed.]
- **[Q-rust-string-num-methods] Rust: String / numeric method-lowering gaps** — bug ·
  **DONE (rust) → #210; cross-backend split → Q-string-num-jstspygo** · `compiler/crates/bock-codegen/src/rs.rs`
  (+ `bock-types/checker.rs` string_concat stamp) · — · links MS-examples-hardening, #210, Q-string-num-jstspygo · note:
  FIXED on RUST by #210 — lowered String `slice`/`substring`/`char_at`/`index_of`/`repeat`/`reverse`/`trim_*` + numeric
  `to_float`/`to_int`/`abs`/`min`/`max`/`clamp`/`floor`/`ceil`/`round`/`sqrt`/… to native rust; new checker `string_concat`
  stamp lowers `String + String` to `format!`. Fixture `exec_rust_string_num_methods` (rust-only). **The same lowerings
  are MISSING on js/ts/python/go → split out to Q-string-num-jstspygo (below).**
- **[Q-string-num-jstspygo] String/numeric method lowering missing on js/ts/python/go (§18.3)** — bug ·
  **DONE → #213 (hotfix #214)** · `compiler/crates/bock-codegen/` (js/ts/py/go) · — · links MS-examples-hardening, #210,
  #213, #214, §18.3, Q-py-windows-utf8 · note: FIXED by #213 — String + numeric/Char/Bool §18.3 methods now lower to each
  target's native idiom on js/ts/python/go (was rust-only #210), gating on `recv_kind = "Primitive:<Ty>"` via
  `try_emit_string_method`/`try_emit_numeric_method`; `generator.rs` untouched. Fixture promoted to all-5
  (`string_num_methods.bock`); conformance 476→480. **microservice ts FAIL→PASS** (the `slice` 3-arg fix); go advanced
  past `String.slice` (now hits the deeper chain — match-binding + Result-payload). **INCIDENT: #213 merged with a
  failing windows-python lane** (the all-5 fixture printed multibyte slice output; Windows-Python stdout = locale codepage,
  not UTF-8 → mismatch). Hotfix **#214** made the fixture ASCII-output; main green. Root product issue → Q-py-windows-utf8.
- **[Q-py-windows-utf8] Bock-generated Python should force UTF-8 stdout (cross-platform unicode)** — bug ·
  **DONE → #218** · `compiler/crates/bock-codegen/` (py) · — · links #213, #214, #218, MS-examples-hardening · note:
  FIXED by #218 — entry-only `sys.stdout/stderr.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8")` in `main.py` (py3.7+; verified not emitted
  in non-entry modules). Re-enables a multibyte-rune fixture later. Original: FOUND 2026-06-03 (#214
  incident). Windows-Python defaults stdout to the locale codepage, so a Bock program that `print`s multibyte/unicode
  emits mismatched/garbled bytes on Windows (passes on Linux/macOS). Emit a stdout UTF-8 reconfigure at the Python entry
  point (`sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8")`, py3.7+, entry module only) so unicode output is cross-platform. Real
  product correctness gap; surfaced when the string_num_methods fixture printed a multibyte slice. Re-enables a
  multibyte-rune-correctness fixture (currently ASCII-only per #214).
- **[Q-js-effect-export] JS: effect-group/stack export referenced but not emitted** — bug ·
  **DONE → #217** · `compiler/crates/bock-codegen/` (js) · — · links MS-examples-hardening, #155, #157, #217 · note:
  FIXED by #217 — a public composite effect now emits a `const X = Object.freeze({__composite:[…]})` binding so the ESM
  export resolves (effect-showcase, task-api, microservice js — all build+run). [Part of the js-backend batch #217.]
- **[Q-py-circular-import] Python: multi-module emit produces a circular import** — bug ·
  **DONE → #218** · `compiler/crates/bock-codegen/` (python) · — · links MS-examples-hardening, #182, #218 · note: FIXED
  by #218 — ROOT CAUSE was the implicit-import scan matching record/enum/class **field-label** tokens in the AIR debug
  dump as cross-module references (`InventorySummary.total_value` field ↔ `service.total_value` fn). Fixed by counting
  field-label occurrences across all label positions and subtracting them from the scan; `models.py` no longer imports
  `service`. inventory-system python now runs (the lone py example that flipped fail→pass in the matrix). [batch #218.]
- **[Q-examples-codegen-misc] Examples audit: minor / per-example codegen + stub-quality gaps** — bug · ready (low-pri,
  triage individually) · `compiler/crates/bock-codegen/`, `examples/` · — · links MS-examples-hardening · note: FOUND
  2026-06-03 (audit). Smaller items surfaced: (a) `todo`/unimplemented expression in return position → `return throw …`
  (js) / `return raise …` (py), invalid syntax — partly example **stub-quality** (guessing-game has unfinished bodies);
  (b) reserved-word / identifier collisions — `eval` (calculator js, `Invalid use of 'eval'`), redeclared `list`
  (todo-list js); (c) `Char` type unmapped on ts/rust/go (type-zoo); (d) go unused-var strictness `declared and not used`
  (guessing-game); (e) local `step2` binding not emitted (calculator go/py `undefined: step2`); (f) **[from #205]**
  `.for_each` with a BLOCK / mutating / `println` closure body fails on go/python (the pre-existing
  statement-closure-body gap — `for_each` lowering itself is correct on rust/js/python; excluded from the all-5 fixture);
  (g) **[from #205]** chained `.map(..).reduce(..)` over a record-field projection mislowers on go (nested-IIFE inference
  gap; binding the projection to a typed `let` first works ×5); (h) **[from #207]** go: a `list.map(...)` result returned
  DIRECTLY lowers its element type to `[]interface{}` (fails `go build`) — go generic-element-typing residue of cluster A
  at the free-fn level; the typed-`let` pattern avoids it; (i) **[from #207]** js/ts: a `let` binding that is REASSIGNED
  (`let list = …; list = list.add(…)`) is emitted as `const` → Node `Identifier 'list' has already been declared` (this
  precisely diagnoses the audit's "redeclared `list`", item (b) — a `let`-reassignment-vs-`const` lowering bug; affects
  todo-list js); (j) **[from #210]** rust: guard-`let` pattern lowered to a boolean guard → E0600/E0425 unbound `val`/`val2`
  (ownership-demo); (k) **[from #210]** rust: `mut <param>` not emitted as `mut` → E0384 (ownership-demo); (l) **[from #210]**
  rust: list-pattern emitted as a slice pattern → E0529 (ownership-demo); (m) **[from #209]** go: Result-payload
  type-assert error after the boxing fix (calculator, effect-showcase go); (n) **[from #213]** go: `Char.to_string()`/
  `display` emits `fmt.Sprintf("%v", rune)` → prints the code-point integer (`65`) not the char (`A`); pre-existing
  primitive-*bridge* path (not the method lowering), compounded by the boxed-Optional Char payload. Triage each as its
  own fix or example correction.
  **RESOLVED in the 5-backend fan-out (#216–#220):** (a) py todo-expr → #218; (i) js let-rebind-const → #217 (ts/py/go
  residue → Q-let-shadow-const); (j) rust guard-let → #216 (other backends → Q-guard-let-shared); (k) rust mut-param →
  #216; (l) rust list-pattern → #216 (shared → Q-list-range-pattern-shared); (m) go Result-payload → #220; (n) go
  Char-display → #220 (`string(rune)`); (d) go unused-var → #220; go int/int64 width → #220; (b) js `eval` reserved-word
  → #217. REMAINING: (c) `Char` type unmapped on rust/go (ts done #219 → string); (e) `step2` local-binding (re-check;
  likely fixed by go batch). Still grab-bag for residual one-offs.

  **RESOLVED-AS-DUP (diagnosed 2026-06-03 13:44)** · — · links Q-match-exprpos · note: the all-5 failure (js `Unexpected
  token ')'`, py `'(' was never closed`, ts `Expression expected`, go enum-return) is the **expression-position
  control-flow lowering** producing unbalanced parens on js/py + the go-enum-return cluster — NOT a distinct root cause.

Q-codegen-completeness (MILESTONE: cross-module + user-enums + generics + Result + traits + Go-typing + …

  ⮑ codegen-completeness milestone #131-#152 essentially DONE — substrate complete + now EXERCISED by a full generic stdlib module (core.iter) on all 5
  ⮑ iter DONE on all 5: module + for→Iterable checker desugar (#151) + Rust/Go generic-combinator codegen (#152), ~300 exec ×5
(decided-ready: Q-import-reject [DQ8])
(subsumed by Q-codegen-completeness: Q-self-subst, Q-prim-assoc, Q-match-exprpos, Q-go-list-literal, Q-ts-generic-impl)
(separate bugs: Q-xmod-bounds, Q-xmod-impl, Q-interp-enum)
```

**Critical path to v1.0 (2026-05-30, updated):** the Optional-payload codegen family is CLOSED across all 5
(#124/#126/#127) and the for→Iterable desugar is PROVEN — but `core.iter` (a sensitive probe) exposed that
the v1 codegen substrate is materially incomplete: a **3-agent audit** found **cross-module `use` and
user-defined enums broken on ALL 5**, and Result/generics/closures/Optional-methods broken on 3-4/5
(audit.md 2026-05-30 18:00). The "5-target parity" #114-#121 restored was real only for a narrow slice; the
3 "landed" stdlib modules are **check-only, never executed cross-module**. Operator decided (2026-05-30): a
**codegen-completeness MILESTONE** (`Q-codegen-completeness`, v1-BLOCKING, ~10-15 PRs, phased P0-P4, mostly
bock-codegen → sequential) — fix comprehensively, THEN resume the stdlib. Updated path:
**Q-codegen-completeness (P0 cross-module+enums+tail-`if` → P1 stdlib-types → P2 traits+match → P3 Go-typing
→ P4 polish) → Q-stdlib R1 (iter, effect) → R2 → R3 → D4 → D5 → ItemB**. Phase-0 design in flight.
