# Queue — active work

**The one question:** what work is to-be / being done?

Orchestrator-owned. Actionable items only (impl / spec / docs / chore /
bug). Factual spec↔impl mismatches live in `divergences.md`; undecided
behavior in `design-questions.md`; version mapping in `milestones.md`;
present-state in `snapshot.md`. Each item has a stable ID, named once
here and referenced elsewhere. Raw OPEN/FOUND tags arrive via PR
descriptions; the orchestrator triages them into the right file.

Schema: `[ID] title — type · status · owned-files · blocked-by ·
links · note`. Status ∈ {ready, in-flight, blocked, deferred}.

_**Last reconciled 2026-07-02 13:17 — release-prep branch (pre-merge). ★★★★★★★ v1.0.0 RELEASE IN MOTION (operator-initiated) — dependabot drained 13/13 + the release-prep PR.**
The operator opened the v1.0 release session and chose: drain the dependabot backlog first, then cut. **Drain (#393–#408, all 13):** merged round-robin per lockfile group, each gated on mergeStateStatus=CLEAN + all checks green post-rebase; majors verified — astro 7 + @astrojs/cloudflare 14 (rebased CI proved them together), rustyline 18 (compiler CI green + a REPL smoke diffed against a pre-bump e03bd14 baseline build — byte-identical behavior, NOT a regression), actions/checkout 7 + actions/cache 6 (workflow pins). Combined-tree main CI green at f3fe228. **Release-prep (this PR):** workspace + 17 internal-dep version refs 0.1.0→1.0.0 · extension 0.1.1→1.0.0 + its CHANGELOG promoted · REPL banner de-hardcoded to `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")` · spec header stamped **1.0.0 / July 2026 / v1.0 release specification** · CHANGELOG regenerated + Unreleased promoted to `## v1.0.0 — 2026-07-02` (fresh empty Unreleased; `gen-changelog.sh --check` GREEN — the release.yml gate) · docs version refs synced (cli.md, tooling.md). Publish preflight done: all 16 existing `bock-*` crates on crates.io are doesdev-owned (verified via owners API; published 2026-04-27); `bock` itself is unclaimed → first-time publish; bock-test-harness publish=false. **2 NEW FOUNDs** (Release-prep FOUND below): `Q-repl-let-persistence` (pre-existing, LOW) · `Q-conformance-rust-stale-binary-reuse` (pre-existing LOCAL-only harness race — 4 runs incl. unmodified main all show shifting rust-only failing sets; CI green throughout and remains the authoritative gate; full diagnosis in the item). **CUT-GATE UPDATE (2026-07-02 late):** secrets CONFIRMED by the operator (CRATES_IO_TOKEN + VSCE_PAT added); the marketing chat returned the **wedge-page copy LOCKED** (rendered → PR #412, publication HELD); `Q-getstarted-copy-lock` remains (its command re-verification is DONE — see the item); the tag awaits the operator's explicit go. Then: tag v1.0.0 → release.yml (6-target binaries · crates.io 16 owned updates + first-time `bock` · marketplace first publish · GitHub release). ↓ —

The post-Wave-C tail closed in two quick rounds: **#388** transpiled-@test enum-variant imports (js/ts/py) · **#389** the diagnostic-code renumbering (5 double-meaning codes split: E1001→E1009/E1005→E1010/E1006→E1011/W8020→W8023/E2030→E2073, vocab regenerated, registry test green) · **#390** the go generic-enum codegen (4 variant-struct sites; fixture now ×5) · **#391** sync-vocab CARGO_TARGET_DIR (FOUND while doing #389).

Process note: Wave 3 + Wave B both ran under the **background-agent Write/Edit constraint** — agents scout/apply via Bash, orchestrator publishes; the recurring stall is agents backgrounding the final gate (recovered each time by committing the already-applied work + CI as the gate).

While the v1 compiler backlog is Design-gated (DQ29/DQ30), the operator opened a new workstream: evaluate the VS Code extension
and improve quality/reliability/feature-set, sequenced **reliability → tests → infra → docs/quick-wins, paralleling where
feasible**. A 2-agent read-only evaluation mapped the extension (~4.8k LOC, 7 feature modules); findings drove two file-disjoint
parallel waves, each combined-tree re-verified locally (npm ci/lint/compile/test) before merge:
**WAVE 1 — reliability (#308 ⨯ #309, disjoint pair):** **#308** activation resilience — a broken (not just missing) `bock`
binary or corrupt `vocab.json` no longer bricks the whole UI (`startLspClient` never throws; `VocabService.load` degrades to an
empty-but-usable vocab; features/commands/context-key always register) + scoped hover command-trust (`isTrusted` →
`{enabledCommands:['bock.openSpecAt']}`). **#309** decision-record schema validation (malformed records dropped+counted+surfaced,
no more crash-on-render) + effect-flow auto-render debounced (was re-running a workspace-wide scan on every hover) + incremental
annotation scan (was full-workspace re-read on every save) + **fixed a real `scanText` triple-quote false-negative** (a `"""` in a
comment/string suppressed all later annotations; pure scanner extracted to `annotations-scan.ts`).
**WAVE 2 — test foundation (#310 ⨯ #311, disjoint pair):** **#310** effect-analyzer parser helpers (matchDelimiter,
findEnclosingFunction [suspected innermost bug proven NOT real], splitBindings, parseWithClause, expandEffects, offsetToLocation)
+ **#311** spec-panel helpers (normalizeRef, buildNavTree, highlightBock, parseSections, stripForSearch, linkifySpecRefs).
Additive `export`s only, zero behavior change. **Extension test suite 7 → 117.**
**2 FOUNDs (real pre-existing bugs surfaced by #310's tests, pinned with KNOWN-BUG tests):** Q-ext-parsewithclause-effect-underreport
(HIGH-ish — same-line `fn f() -> T with E {` has its ` with E` eaten by the greedy return-type strip → the effect-flow panel
under-reports effects for MOST functions, the dominant signature shape) + Q-ext-splitbindings-string-aware (LOW). **Remaining
extension threads (queued, not started):** Q-ext-infra-webview-consolidation (thread 3 — invasive), Q-ext-docs-and-quickwins
(thread 4), + a feature-opportunity backlog (richer hover, spec-search ranking, decisions filtering — many align with the
extension's own README v1.1 roadmap). ↓ —

### Release-prep FOUND (filed 2026-07-02, surfaced by the rustyline-18 REPL smoke)

- **[Q-website-astro7-migration] website: migrate to astro 7 + @astrojs/cloudflare 14 (majors REVERTED 2026-07-02)** — chore · ready · `website/` · — · links: #407/#401 (the reverted dependabot majors), the revert PR · note: astro 7.0.3–7.0.5 + cloudflare 14.1.0 break `astro build` for this site's `output:'static'` + cloudflare-adapter config ("Could not find the prerender entry point", `static-build.js getPrerenderEntryFileName`). Reverted to astro ^6.4.8 + cloudflare ^13.7.0 (build green). Migration options: track the upstream fix; or drop the adapter for static output and hand-write the wrangler static-assets config (the adapter currently manages KV-session/images bindings — see astro.config.mjs comments). Do with time to verify `wrangler deploy`; NOT release-gating. Dependabot will re-open the majors — with docs.yml's new pull_request trigger they now build pre-merge and stay visibly red until this lands.
- **[Q-scaffold-starter-indent] `bock new` starter main.bock uses 4-space indent (house style + website show 2-space)** — bug/chore · ready · `compiler/crates/bock-cli/` (scaffold template) · — · links Q-getstarted-copy-lock re-verification · note: CLAUDE.md Bock style + the /get-started page's starter snippet are 2-space; the emitted starter is 4-space. One-line template fix; also check `bock fmt` accepts the starter as-is. LOW. FOUND 2026-07-02.
- **[Q-conformance-rust-stale-binary-reuse] conformance rust execution lane: nondeterministic cross-fixture STALE-BINARY reuse under the harness's shared private `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` (LOCAL-only; CI unaffected)** — bug/test-harness · ready · `compiler/tests/execution.rs` · — · links: release-prep gate 2026-07-02 · note: 4 runs, 4 DIFFERENT failing sets (10/10/8 on the release branch; **12 on unmodified main f3fe228** — diff exonerated), ALL rust-target-only, each failing fixture printing a DIFFERENT fixture's stdout (e.g. `eq_tuple` printed `eq_result_wrapper_structural`'s output) — i.e. `cargo run` executed a stale `target/debug/bock_app` from an earlier fixture. All scaffolded fixtures share ONE process-wide private target dir (`rust_target_dir()` OnceLock + `set_var`) and the constant package name `bock_app`; suspected mechanism: cargo's binary-uplift skip on an mtime tie under fast consecutive builds (a 2-fixture manual repro seconds apart does NOT reproduce; the full ~250-build run does, set varying per run → timing-dependent). CI green on the same commits (slower runners / different FS timing) — **CI remains the authoritative gate**; per-PR CI + main CI were green throughout. Suggested fix: per-fixture target subdir (`rust_target_dir().join(&case.name)`) passed EXPLICITLY to both the `bock build` cmd env and the run step, dropping the process-wide `set_var`. Until fixed, local full-gate runs on fast boxes may show phantom rust-lane conformance failures — verify against CI before chasing. MED (dev-experience, release-blind-spot risk), v1.x — does not gate the cut.
- **[Q-repl-let-persistence] REPL: `let` bindings do not persist across lines (module doc claims "persistent environment")** — bug · ready · `compiler/crates/bock-cli/src/repl.rs` · — · links: the #402 drain smoke · note: `let x = 21 * 2` then `print("answer: ${x}")` → E1009 undefined name — the second entry is wrapped as `fn __repl_2__() { … }` without the earlier binding in scope. PRE-EXISTING (reproduced identically on pre-rustyline-18 baseline e03bd14; NOT a #402 regression); observed under piped/non-TTY input, interactive TTY unverified. Side-observation for the fixer: the did-you-mean suggestion differed across two otherwise-identical builds ("Fn" vs "Ok") — possible suggestion tie-break nondeterminism. LOW, v1.x — does not gate the cut.

### v1.0-hardening FOUND/OPEN (filed 2026-06-15, surfaced by #352–#357)

Bugs (→ queue, for a later wave):
- **[Q-py-valuepos-match-payload-namebind] python: value-position `match` with a payload-binding arm mis-lowers to a broken lambda (bound var unbound → `NameError`)** — bug · ready · `compiler/crates/bock-codegen/src/py.rs` · — · links #353 · note: js/ts/rust/go correct; Python only. FOUND 2026-06-15 (#353).

FOUND 2026-06-15 (#353).
- **[Q-py-go-wrapper-structural-eq] structural `Optional`/`Result` `==` broken on Python (`_BockSome`/`_BockOk` lack `__eq__`); custom-`eq`-inside-wrapper corner on Go (unexported reflection fields)** — bug · ready · `compiler/crates/bock-codegen/src/{py,go}.rs` · — · links #357, DQ31 · note: pre-existing, surfaced building DQ31 fixtures (which use List/Map/record-wrapper composition instead); the Optional/Result wrapper element-eq corner is the follow-up. FOUND 2026-06-15 (#357).
- **[Q-core-bool-compare-dead] bock-core registers `Bool.compare` but Bool is NOT `Comparable` (§18.5) — dead registration** — chore · ready · LOW · `compiler/crates/bock-core/` · — · links #354 · note: harmless (checker rejects `bool.compare` with E4003); left returning `Ordering` for consistency. Remove on next bock-core touch. FOUND 2026-06-15 (#354).

Design questions (→ Design hub; captured here so they're not lost — formalize as DQ entries next session):
- **OPEN: code-numbering collisions** — `E1001`/`E1005`/`E1006` each carry two meanings (lexer vs resolver); `W8020` has two (effect-unused vs PII-tainted-signature); `E2030` is emitted both for parens-required and for a missing fn name in `parse_fn_decl`. Renumbering is a design decision (not done unilaterally). FOUND 2026-06-15 (#356).
- **OPEN: Hashable-on-collection-keys enforcement** — a custom-`eq` type used as a `Map` KEY / `Set` MEMBER needs `Hashable` to be constructible on Rust/Go/Python (`HashMap`/`HashSet` require `Hash+Eq`), but `bock check` doesn't enforce `Hashable` on collection keys, so such programs pass the checker but emit uncompilable Rust. Pre-existing, independent of `==`. FOUND 2026-06-15 (#357).
- **OPEN: transitively-forwarded *unbounded* generic params** — a `fn g[U](x)` with no bound that forwards `x` into a `Comparable`-requiring callee is still accepted (arg is an unsolved `TypeVar`). Pre-existing; the `where`-clause path behaves identically (so #355 is at parity, not a regression). Catching it is a broader soundness improvement applying to both bound forms. FOUND 2026-06-15 (#355).

Skip unreadable dirs gracefully; the sibling scan reaching /tmp at all looks over-broad. Env-only (CI's clean /tmp passes), but a real latent fragility. FOUND 2026-06-15 (combined gate).

- **OPEN: no CI guard for vocab.json / assets-spec ↔ compiler/spec drift** — the drift #368 fixed went unnoticed because nothing re-runs `sync-vocab.sh` and diffs. A CI check (run sync-vocab, assert no diff) would catch it. Process/infra. FOUND 2026-06-15 (#368).

### Positioning follow-ups (filed 2026-06-15, from the OQ1/R1 marketing resolution)

The marketing-positioning resolution landed (§1.1 amendment + tracking; see `escalations.md`
2026-06-15 05:02 + `milestones.md` POSITIONING RESOLVED). These are the downstream work items it
spawned. The identity sentence + all website copy are **marketing-owned + human-approved** — engineer
work is the demo only; the copy items ESCALATE before any external publication.

- **[Q-sdk-vendor-demo] verified SDK-vendor demo** — impl · ready · `examples/` + a conformance report ·
  — · links OQ1, handoff · note: the proof surface for the wedge use-cases page — ONE Bock source →
  `bock build` emits native packages across all 5 targets (npm/pip/cargo/go-mod) with transpiled tests,
  + a real conformance report showing identical behavior. Code must pass `bock check`; package-emit +
  conformance output must be REAL (no mockups). Engineer-dispatchable; **gates the wedge-page copy lock.**
- **[Q-wedge-usecases-page] SDK-vendor wedge use-cases page** — marketing/content · in-flight
  (copy LOCKED 20260702-2114 UTC, operator-approved; route `/use-cases`; RENDERED verbatim → **PR #412,
  HELD for operator publication approval** — merging publishes via the Docs Pages deploy; not in the
  global Nav, nav placement = publication decision) · `website/src/pages/use-cases.astro` · — · links
  OQ1, handoff · note: fidelity-verified against the locked copy (11 sentence checks, no em dashes,
  verified/conformance verbs only); demo links → the `examples/sdk-vendor-demo` GitHub tree.

  `website/` get-started · — · links R1, ItemD, handoff · note: was gated on R1 (now signed). Marketing
  locks the copy against the signed identity; implementation renders. **ESCALATES (external content).**
  **Command re-verification DONE (2026-07-02, orchestrator, against the v1.0.0 tree):** `bock --version`
  → `bock 1.0.0` ✓ · `bock new hello` scaffold tree/`[ai]`-commented-block/`.gitignore` ✓ · `bock build
  --target js|go` ✓ (long-form flag works) · `bock run` ✓ · `node build/js/main.js` → "Hello, world!" ✓ ·
  js = console.log + ES modules (`"type":"module"`) ✓ · go = fmt.Println ✓ · docs-SUMMARY link ✓ ·
  GitHub Discussions ENABLED ✓. Caveats for the marketing pass: (1) `cargo install bock` verifiable only
  post-publish; (2) r/bocklang unverifiable from CI (reddit 403) — confirm manually; (3) the page's
  starter snippet shows 2-space indent, the scaffold emits 4-space (→ `Q-scaffold-starter-indent`);
  (4) page says "the `.bock/` cache directory" but the emitted `.gitignore` lists `.bock/` subpaths
  (`decisions/runtime`, `ai-cache`, `cache`) + `target/` — wording nuance, marketing's call.

### Design-audit follow-ups (filed 2026-06-10, from `designs/2026-06-09-design-audit.md`)

  bef33b7): mental model, toolchain quickstart, idiom primer, v1-boundary, error-code table (sourced from
  `bock-errors/src/catalog.rs` cross-checked against real emission sites), 5 RUN-verified worked examples, 20 pitfalls,
  10 dated Known Divergences. Drift guard: `verify-context-pack.sh` runs `bock check` on every ```bock block (15/15 pass;
  negative path verified). Authoring doubled as a compiler probe: 10 FOUND + 2 DV filed (harvest section below; DV20/DV21).

  emits one verified record per fixture (schema 1.0.0: source + per-target `--source-only` trees + declared expectations +
  live `bock check` evidence for diagnostic fixtures). Clean run: 261 records (exec 206 / static 41 / diagnostic 14),
  1054/1054 target pairs ok, byte-deterministic, ~6s. Directive grammar mirrored line-by-line from
  `compiler/tests/harness/`; `HARNESS_WIRED_DIAGNOSTIC_CATEGORIES` tracks which dirs CI actually asserts (→
  Q-conformance-directive-wiring). **Output stays uncommitted/gitignored — publication is OQ2 (operator).** 2 stale-fixture

### Dogfood/context-pack defect harvest (filed 2026-06-10, FOUND via #336–#339)

The design-audit follow-up wave doubled as the deepest off-fixture probe of the compiler yet (a real Bock tool ×5 + 15
verified primer examples + 43 diagnostic runs). Everything below is off-conformance-coverage — which is itself the finding
(see Q-conformance-directive-wiring and the snapshot ledger caveat).

  (also fixed a second defect in the same arm: mid-block `else if` emitted `el` + indented `if` → SyntaxError). The
  prompted same-pattern audit FOUND + FIXED one more instance: non-diverging `guard` else also truncated via
  `return print(...)` (`emit_stmt_guard`) — and exposed that the checker ACCEPTS non-diverging guard else at all → DV22.

The five-lane correctness wave (#341–#345) closed the harvest HIGHs and — being itself a deep probe (5 new fixtures ×5

  structural) for structural-default elements; per-element `eq` loop ONLY when an element carries a custom
  `impl Equatable`; Map/Set key-matching + membership route through the custom `eq`. **Step 3:** ×5 fixtures incl. the
  custom-`eq` `Map` case that currently diverges under structural compare (the corner #347 left deliberately un-pinned),
  nested-container provenance, and poison-rejection on both paths. Codegen specialization is an optimization note (not

  FOUND (pre-existing, orthogonal) → Q-rust-host-sleep-tokio-dep. ORIG: the time host primitives were inlined per-target and
  bypassed the installed `Clock` handler, so `sleep` always hit the real host. Pairs with Q-time-shim-path.
- **[Q-conformance-clean-rebuild] Conformance harness doesn't force a clean `bock` rebuild** — chore/test-infra ·
  **DONE (#175)** · note: `run-conformance.sh` now `touch`es `compiler/crates/bock-cli/build.rs` + runs
  `cargo build -p bock --bin bock` before the tests, forcing a stdlib re-embed so `execution.rs::bock_binary()` can't
  reuse a stale sibling binary. Root cause confirmed: the build.rs `rerun-if-changed` on the stdlib tree misses a
  newly-added nested subdir. Local-verification false-REDs resolved.

  also describes conformance as `<name>.bock`/`<name>.expected` pairs, but the harness is `// TEST:`/`// EXPECT:`
  directive-driven. The D5 docs page documents reality + notes the divergence; reconcile these three source files to the
  real 17-crate workspace. (CLAUDE.md files are orchestrator/merge-coordinator territory.)

  runtime-error), folded into Q-py-circular-import (K) + a trait-symbol-not-emitted residue — **no remaining BUILD-level
  work here**. Original: FOUND 2026-06-03 (audit). A constant or
  enum-variant name is emitted with one casing at the DEFINITION and another at the USE site: TS defines `FIZZ_NUM` but
  references `fizzNUM` (`Did you mean 'FIZZ_NUM'?`); `Category_Electronics`/`Allocatable` referenced-but-undefined; python
  references `FIZZ_NUM` but never emits the def at module scope. Normalize the identifier transform so def and use agree
  (and ensure module-scope consts are emitted). Examples: fizzbuzz, inventory-system, systems-allocator. Likely cheap.

  Q-list-concat-codegen, MS-examples-hardening, Q-go-error-message/Q-error-message-jstspy · note: FIXED by #207 —
  `check_item` now recurses into `ImplBlock`/`ClassDecl`, type-checking each method body as a function with `self` bound
  to the target + impl generics/`Self` substituted (`build_impl_context`). **Measure-then-fix blast radius was small +
  fully resolved:** turning on body-checking surfaced exactly two latent issues — (1) a **REAL pre-existing bug** in
  `core.error` (`impl Error for SimpleError { fn message(self)->String { self.message } }`: a `FieldAccess` to a field
  whose name collides with a method resolved the METHOD in value position → E4001; affected ALL core modules transitively
  + user-facing; fixed by preferring the same-named field in value position, method *calls* re-resolve via new
  `resolve_user_method_fn_type`), and (2) a `Self`-in-plain-impl return-type **false positive** (the `TypeSelf` arm now
  consults `gp_map["Self"]`). Conformance **455→460** (REQUIRE=all; +5 new `exec_method_body_list_ops` ×5). Negative
  diagnostics fixtures added (impl + class method-body type errors now caught). **HONEST PAYOFF:** the value is the
  **correctness** dimension (catching method-body type errors + the latent core.error bug) — NOT new codegen reach:
  example output (todo-list ×5) is **byte-identical** before/after because codegen already had robust syntactic fallbacks
  for method-body list ops. NEW residue OPENs surfaced (pre-existing, codegen-crate) → folded into Q-examples-codegen-misc
  (h)/(i). [The core.error checker-resolution fix is distinct from the codegen field/method collision work in
  Q-go-error-message/#191 + Q-error-message-jstspy/#193 — same pain point, different layer.]

  Q-string-num-jstspygo, Q-match-exprpos · note: FIXED by #209 (4 root causes: block-in-expr-position closure dropped
  its statements + hardcoded `func() interface{}`; if/match IIFEs didn't propagate the concrete type into branch/arm
  bodies; untyped `let m = if{…}` over variants typed its closure from the fn return; void-call arm tails emitted
  `return println(..)` → the `(int,error)` arity error). Conformance +5 (`exec_enum_return_boxing` ×5). **HONEST: cleared
  the boxing/arity barrier on all 4 go examples but go examples STILL fail (matrix go 1/20 unchanged) — each now hits a
  NEXT barrier** (chat-protocol→early-return-trapped-in-IIFE = Q-match-exprpos; microservice→String.slice = Q-string-num-
  jstspygo + expr-position type-switch payload; calculator/effect-showcase→a single Result-payload type-assert on go).

  past `String.slice` (now hits the deeper chain — match-binding + Result-payload). **INCIDENT: #213 merged with a
  failing windows-python lane** (the all-5 fixture printed multibyte slice output; Windows-Python stdout = locale codepage,
  not UTF-8 → mismatch). Hotfix **#214** made the fixture ASCII-output; main green. Root product issue → Q-py-windows-utf8.

  FIXED by #218 — entry-only `sys.stdout/stderr.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8")` in `main.py` (py3.7+; verified not emitted
  in non-entry modules). Re-enables a multibyte-rune fixture later. Original: FOUND 2026-06-03 (#214
  incident). Windows-Python defaults stdout to the locale codepage, so a Bock program that `print`s multibyte/unicode
  emits mismatched/garbled bytes on Windows (passes on Linux/macOS). Emit a stdout UTF-8 reconfigure at the Python entry
  point (`sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8")`, py3.7+, entry module only) so unicode output is cross-platform. Real
  product correctness gap; surfaced when the string_num_methods fixture printed a multibyte slice. Re-enables a
  multibyte-rune-correctness fixture (currently ASCII-only per #214).

  FIXED by #217 — a public composite effect now emits a `const X = Object.freeze({__composite:[…]})` binding so the ESM
  export resolves (effect-showcase, task-api, microservice js — all build+run). [Part of the js-backend batch #217.]

  by #218 — ROOT CAUSE was the implicit-import scan matching record/enum/class **field-label** tokens in the AIR debug
  dump as cross-module references (`InventorySummary.total_value` field ↔ `service.total_value` fn). Fixed by counting
  field-label occurrences across all label positions and subtracting them from the scan; `models.py` no longer imports
  `service`. inventory-system python now runs (the lone py example that flipped fail→pass in the matrix). [batch #218.]
- **[Q-examples-codegen-misc] Examples audit: minor / per-example codegen + stub-quality gaps** — bug · ready (low-pri,
  triage individually) · `compiler/crates/bock-codegen/`, `examples/` · — · links MS-examples-hardening · note: FOUND
  2026-06-03 (audit). Smaller items surfaced: (a) `todo`/unimplemented expression in return position → `return throw …`
  (js) / `return raise …` (py), invalid syntax — partly example **stub-quality** (guessing-game has unfinished bodies);
  (b) reserved-word / identifier collisions — `eval` (calculator js, `Invalid use of 'eval'`), redeclared `list`
  (todo-list js); (c) `Char` type unmapped on ts/rust/go (type-zoo); (d) go unused-var strictness `declared and not used`
  (guessing-game); (e) local `step2` binding not emitted (calculator go/py `undefined: step2`); (f) **[from #205]**
  `.for_each` with a BLOCK / mutating / `println` closure body fails on go/python (the pre-existing
  statement-closure-body gap — `for_each` lowering itself is correct on rust/js/python; excluded from the all-5 fixture);
  (g) **[from #205]** chained `.map(..).reduce(..)` over a record-field projection mislowers on go (nested-IIFE inference
  gap; binding the projection to a typed `let` first works ×5); (h) **[from #207]** go: a `list.map(...)` result returned
  DIRECTLY lowers its element type to `[]interface{}` (fails `go build`) — go generic-element-typing residue of cluster A
  at the free-fn level; the typed-`let` pattern avoids it; (i) **[from #207]** js/ts: a `let` binding that is REASSIGNED
  (`let list = …; list = list.add(…)`) is emitted as `const` → Node `Identifier 'list' has already been declared` (this
  precisely diagnoses the audit's "redeclared `list`", item (b) — a `let`-reassignment-vs-`const` lowering bug; affects
  todo-list js); (j) **[from #210]** rust: guard-`let` pattern lowered to a boolean guard → E0600/E0425 unbound `val`/`val2`
  (ownership-demo); (k) **[from #210]** rust: `mut <param>` not emitted as `mut` → E0384 (ownership-demo); (l) **[from #210]**
  rust: list-pattern emitted as a slice pattern → E0529 (ownership-demo); (m) **[from #209]** go: Result-payload
  type-assert error after the boxing fix (calculator, effect-showcase go); (n) **[from #213]** go: `Char.to_string()`/
  `display` emits `fmt.Sprintf("%v", rune)` → prints the code-point integer (`65`) not the char (`A`); pre-existing
  primitive-*bridge* path (not the method lowering), compounded by the boxed-Optional Char payload. Triage each as its
  own fix or example correction.
  **RESOLVED in the 5-backend fan-out (#216–#220):** (a) py todo-expr → #218; (i) js let-rebind-const → #217 (ts/py/go
  residue → Q-let-shadow-const); (j) rust guard-let → #216 (other backends → Q-guard-let-shared); (k) rust mut-param →
  #216; (l) rust list-pattern → #216 (shared → Q-list-range-pattern-shared); (m) go Result-payload → #220; (n) go
  Char-display → #220 (`string(rune)`); (d) go unused-var → #220; go int/int64 width → #220; (b) js `eval` reserved-word
  → #217. REMAINING: (c) `Char` type unmapped on rust/go (ts done #219 → string); (e) `step2` local-binding (re-check;
  likely fixed by go batch). Still grab-bag for residual one-offs.

  ⮑ codegen-completeness milestone #131-#152 essentially DONE — substrate complete + now EXERCISED by a full generic stdlib module (core.iter) on all 5
  ⮑ iter DONE on all 5: module + for→Iterable checker desugar (#151) + Rust/Go generic-combinator codegen (#152), ~300 exec ×5
(decided-ready: Q-import-reject [DQ8])

```

**Critical path to v1.0 (2026-05-30, updated):** the Optional-payload codegen family is CLOSED across all 5
(#124/#126/#127) and the for→Iterable desugar is PROVEN — but `core.iter` (a sensitive probe) exposed that
the v1 codegen substrate is materially incomplete: a **3-agent audit** found **cross-module `use` and
user-defined enums broken on ALL 5**, and Result/generics/closures/Optional-methods broken on 3-4/5
(audit.md 2026-05-30 18:00). The "5-target parity" #114-#121 restored was real only for a narrow slice; the
3 "landed" stdlib modules are **check-only, never executed cross-module**. Operator decided (2026-05-30): a
**codegen-completeness MILESTONE** (`Q-codegen-completeness`, v1-BLOCKING, ~10-15 PRs, phased P0-P4, mostly
bock-codegen → sequential) — fix comprehensively, THEN resume the stdlib. Updated path:
**Q-codegen-completeness (P0 cross-module+enums+tail-`if` → P1 stdlib-types → P2 traits+match → P3 Go-typing
→ P4 polish) → Q-stdlib R1 (iter, effect) → R2 → R3 → D4 → D5 → ItemB**. Phase-0 design in flight.
